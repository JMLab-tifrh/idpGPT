# Datasets used for training
The dataset of sequences used for training the Protein Language Models are present here.</br>
These have been obtained from Saar et al., PNAS, 2018 ([link](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2019053118))
- LLPS+ : IDPs with critical LLPS concentration $< 100$ $\mu M$. The corresponding file is llps_plus.fasta. 
- LLPS- : IDPs with critical LLPS concentration $> 100$ $\mu M$. The corresponding file is llps_minus.fasta.
- PDB* : proteins that do not undergo LLPS under normal conditions. The corresponding file is noPS.fasta.
